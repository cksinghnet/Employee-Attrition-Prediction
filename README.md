## Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a critical issue for many organizations as it can lead to increased costs and loss of valuable talent. Predicting employee attrition can help organizations take proactive measures to retain employees, improve job satisfaction, and reduce turnover rates.

## Dataset Summary
The dataset used for this project contains information about employees, including their demographics, job roles, and performance metrics. The dataset consists of [number of records] records and [number of features] features. The data is sourced from [source of the dataset].

## Approach and Methods
To predict employee attrition, we employed several machine learning techniques and methodologies:
- **Handling Class Imbalance**: We used Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance in the dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: We performed feature selection to identify the most relevant features for the prediction model.
- **Grid Search**: We used grid search to tune the hyperparameters of our machine learning models to achieve the best performance.
